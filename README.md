# Algorithmic Problem Solving

This repository contains a curated collection of **algorithmic problem studies**
designed to demonstrate core concepts in **algorithm design, correctness, and
complexity analysis**.

Rather than providing exhaustive or introductory examples, the focus is on
problems that require **non-trivial reasoning**, careful state or graph modeling,
and informed algorithm selection.

---

## Scope

The problems in this repository cover a broad range of fundamental algorithmic
paradigms, including:

- Selection and partition-based algorithms
- Non-comparison-based sorting techniques
- Dynamic programming with structural constraints
- Two-dimensional optimization problems
- Graph algorithms for dependency resolution
- Shortest-path-based graph metrics

Each problem is implemented as a standalone study with a clear conceptual focus.

## Included Studies

- **Selection Algorithms with QuickSelect**  
  Efficient order-statistic computation using partition-based strategies.

- **String Sorting with Radix-Based Techniques**  
  Linear-time string sorting using non-comparison-based methods.

- **Dynamic Programming with Constraints**  
  One-dimensional dynamic programming under adjacency and feasibility constraints.

- **Two-Dimensional Dynamic Programming Optimization**  
  Rectangle partitioning and optimization using 2D dynamic programming.

- **Graph Dependency Resolution**  
  Resolving cyclic dependencies using strongly connected components and
  topological ordering.

- **Graph Metrics and Shortest Path Analysis**  
  Deriving custom pairwise metrics from shortest path computations
  on directed, weighted graphs.

## Design Principles

Across all studies, emphasis is placed on:

- Clear problem modeling
- Appropriate algorithm selection
- Explicit reasoning about time and space complexity
- Avoidance of unnecessary brute-force approaches
- Clean and readable implementations

## Notes

Some of the problems originated from structured academic settings and were
refined to emphasize **algorithmic insight** and **solution quality** rather
than exam-oriented presentation.
