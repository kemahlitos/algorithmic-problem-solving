# Algorithmic Problem Solving

This repository contains a curated collection of **algorithmic problem solutions**
covering a wide range of core computer science topics.

The problems focus on **algorithm design, correctness, and complexity analysis**,
rather than on language-specific implementations.

---

## Topics Covered

- Selection and partition-based algorithms
- Non-comparison-based sorting techniques
- Dynamic programming with complex constraints
- Two-dimensional optimization problems
- Graph algorithms and dependency resolution
- Shortest and longest path analysis in directed graphs
- Complexity-aware algorithm selection

Each problem is implemented as a standalone study with a clear algorithmic focus.

## Notes

Some of the problems originated from structured academic settings and were refined
to emphasize algorithmic insight, clean design, and reasoning about time and space
complexity.
